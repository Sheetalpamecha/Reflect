When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my project with other people.Also When I am working on a
    collaborative project.I also sometimes use them when I want to be able to edit 
    code from multiple different computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the
    computers.  Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of my work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code,
    it doesn't change without me expecting it.  For example, if I know the new
    version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until
    the bug is fixed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Branch - It is done when we want to branch out a commit into multiple 
	versions.
	Clone - Downloading an entire history of a repository from Github to 
	our local system. 
    Fork - It is just a clone that github makes on their own machine. From one 
    account to another person's account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If we are offline We can easily check what are the changes happen in remote
    And comparing the local remote and remote on github we can get a log of what
    new changes are done to the repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using Google Docs. Google Docs are great for collaboration, but I don't know 
    a good version of Google Docs for code. Even if I did, I would be hesitant to 
    use this approach on code that it's important to keep bug-free.I would be 
    worried that someone else would add a change that combined with my change to 
    make a bug, and I might not even notice their change!

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

       I tend to work directly in master more often when I'm working on my own or
    with just one or two other people.  When working with a large group, though,
    using branches to keep track of which changes have already been reviewed and
    approved is extremely helpful.
