When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my project with other people.Also When I am working on a
    collaborative project.I also sometimes use them when I want to be able to edit 
    code from multiple different computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the
    computers.  Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of my work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code,
    it doesn't change without me expecting it.  For example, if I know the new
    version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until
    the bug is fixed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Branch - It is done when we want to branch out a commit into multiple 
	versions.
	Clone - Downloading an entire history of a repository from Github to 
	our local system. 
    Fork - It is just a clone that github makes on their own machine. From one 
    account to another person's account.
